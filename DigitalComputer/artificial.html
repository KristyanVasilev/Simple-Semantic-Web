        <p font size="10">Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to
            natural
            intelligence displayed by animals including humans. “Artificial intelligence" to describe machines
            that mimic
            "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem
            solving". Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity and have
            been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. These characters and
            their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.
