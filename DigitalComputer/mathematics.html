	<p font size="10">Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra),
		space (geometry), and change (analysis). It has no generally accepted definition. Mathematicians seek and use
		patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When
		mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight
		or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting,
		calculation, measurement and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical
		mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve
		mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
