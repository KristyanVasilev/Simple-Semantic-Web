    <p font size="10">In economics. competition is a scenario where different economic firms are in contention to obtain
        goods that are limited by varying the elements of the marketing mix: price, product, promotion and place. In
        classical economic thought, competition causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and
        technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater the selection of a
        good is in the market, prices are typically lower for the products, compared to what the price would be if there
        was no competition (monopoly) or little competition (oligopoly).
